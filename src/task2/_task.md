Homework: concert tickets
Create 2 Java classes -“Ticket” and “TicketService”
The “Ticket" class should have the following variables:

○ concert hall (max 10 chars)
○ event code (3 digits)
○ time (Unix timestamp)
○ is promo
○ stadium sector (from ‘A’ to ‘C’)
○ max allowed backpack weight in kg (with grams precision)
Choose the [name] [data type], [access modifier] and [variable type] carefully, depending on a [variable] purpose.
There should be the ability to create a Ticket instance with all parameters initialised and also a limited one - [concert hall], [event code] and
[time].
The “TicketService" class should contain main function.
3 tickets should be created - empty, full and limited.

* Add an ability to automatically detect and save Ticket creation time.
*** Add the ability to save ticket price. This should be a new variable, think carefully about the type.
